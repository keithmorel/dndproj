# DnD Dice Rolling Website (more to come)
Small webapp for rolling different sided dice, and in the future, for creating character design sheets, saving to user accounts, etc.

## Current Features
1. Functioning nav bar
2. Roll Dice page working at a usable level: can roll as many of whatever die you want, with modifiers.
3. Make character sheet found after logging in with admin profile
4. Created characters are saved onto the local database table
5. Database can be cleared with a button on the same page
6. User is able to view, update, and delete character sheets from the list
7. On the view page for each character, user is able to roll strength, using the current value, on a d20 with the modifier.

## TODO
~~1. Get a database up and running~~
2. Get a user system going, where users can make their own character sheets and save them
3. Get the site hosted not locally
4. Add much more CSS, pictures, etc.
5. Add to the alignment details page so that it includes more information about all of the stats on the character creation sheet

## Future
1. Be able to connect character sheets involved in same DnD game, allowing real-time updating of health, stats, etc.
2. Next to your character attributes, be able to take your current attribute level into account and roll a d20 with correct modifier automatically.
