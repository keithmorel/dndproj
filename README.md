# DnD Dice Rolling Website (more to come)
Small webapp for rolling different sided dice, and in the future, for creating character design sheets, saving to user accounts, etc.

## Current Features
1. Functioning nav bar (besides login/logout)
2. Roll Dice page working at a usable level: can roll as many of whatever die you want, with modifiers.
3. Make character sheet layout and fields are fine, just no functionality yet.

## TODO
1. Get a database up and running
2. Get a user system going, where users can make their own character sheets and save them
3. Get the site hosted not locally
4. Add much more CSS, pictures, etc.

## Future
1. Be able to connect character sheets involved in same DnD game, allowing real-time updating of health, stats, etc.
2. Next to your character attributes, be able to take your current attribute level into account and roll a d20 with correct modifier automatically.
